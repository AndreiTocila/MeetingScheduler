## Meeting scheduler
Final project for "Python Programming" course.

## Short Presentation
A graphic application that is able to manage meetings with the help of a PostgreSQL database.

## Implementation details
I choose to use a multi-layer architecture:
* Presentation layer (UI)
* Service layer + Validators
* Data layer


Validation is made on Service layer using the Validators and every functionality is implemented in a separated class.
